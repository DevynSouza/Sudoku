Project 3 -- Game
-------------------------------------------------------
Tests  


-------------------------------------------------------
main.cpp
1.   -- Download file name  
    ***What does this mean?

2. File opening now done correclty in game

3. A call on fatal() ends execution. This should be a 1-line if statement.
    * 1 lined the fatal statement

4. Line 88 is beginner coding.  When there are exactly two possibilities, there is no need for an else clause..  
    Unclean as the if/else if more readable but noted and fixed

-------------------------------------------------------
Game.hpp 
    1.  Ugly.  Public first again.  
            ** private now first in every header


-1  2.  No inline functions. Where is the destructor"  
            ** Added default destructor

    3.  When you include board.hpp, you do not need a forward declaration.  One uses forward declarations to 
            **No idea but it was removed sometime during P5

-------------------------------------------------------
Game.cpp
    1.  The comment on line 7 is wrong.  Fix it. 
            **Fixed
-1  2.  Why are you using get() in C++ to read one character?  Use the appropriate input operator.
            **Used the >> operator
    3.  You have WAY too many blank lines in your file, demonstrating a lack of experience.
            **I like blank lines as they split up pieces to make things more readable. Too much clustered together is hard to read.

-1  4.  The test on line 29 is unacceptable.  DO NOT USE DIGITS in this program for menu selections.  Your poor user will get hopelessly confused.  You need digits for the row, the column, and the value.  Give the poor user a break.
            **No idea but the issue is fixed in P5

    5.  Also, please let your user enter all three numbers on one prompt.  Otherwise he will hate you.
            **Declined, maybe will change later. But I'm not sure how to do it in a way that is not-confusing to the user and also works well. 

    6.  You should put the entire switch in place now, and implement the appropriate option(s). You did not implement a Quit option.  That is the only one you need for P3.
            **Quit has always been there as it is a part of the while loop. No need for a case statement.
            **Added, regardless it will never work

    7.  The test in line 29 is unnecessary.  If you do everything else right, you can use a for(;;)
            **I am not a fan of the for(;;), the while loop is more structured and has a determinate end
