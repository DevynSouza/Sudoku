Test Plan::

Ensure in the input file the board type is set to d

Call program and provide test.txt as a command line argument
    ./myapp test.txt

Input 7 while in the menu to test the program functions
    This will mark at [1,1].
    Then call the square::test() function which will print out the clusters (row, column, box, diag)
        **This should show what has been marked

    Then again mark will be called at [9,1]
    Then call the square::test() function again and print out the clusters (row, column, box, diag)
        **The output will share the same row cluster but seperate column, box and diag clusters. 
            **Row should be the only cluster shooped twice

    Lastly, 6 is pressed in the menu to exit the program.
